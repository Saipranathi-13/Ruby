Ruby: Ruby is a server side scripting language is a dynamic,open-source, object-oriented and reflective programming language.
1. It is fully object-oriented programming language.
2. Each and every code has their properities(variables) and actions(methods).
3. Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.
Ruby features:
   1. Object-oriented: purely object-oriented
   2. Flexibility: can easily remove, redefine or add 
   3. Mixins: Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible.
   4. Visual appearance: Ruby generally prefers English keywords and some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby. It doesn't need a variable declaration.
   5. Dynamic typing and Duck typing: Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.
   6. Variable constants: In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.
   7. Naming conventions: Ruby defines some naming conventions for its variable, method, constant and class.
                          Constant: Starts with a capital letter.
                          Global variable: Starts with a dollar sign ($).
                          Instance variable: Starts with a (@) sign.
                          Class variable: Starts with a (@@) sign.
                          Method name: Allowed to start with a capital letter.
   8. Keyword arguments: methods can also be defined using keyword arguments.
   9. Method names: Methods are allowed to end with question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). By convention, methods that answer questions end with question mark and methods that indicates that method can change the state of the object end with exclamation mark.
   10. Singleton methods: Ruby singleton methods are per-object methods. They are only available on the object you defined it on.
   11. Missing method: Ruby calls the method_missing method with name of the lost method.
   12. Case Sensitive: Ruby is a case-sensitive language. Lowercase letters and uppercase letters are different.
Ruby variables: Ruby variables are locations which hold data to be used in the programs. Each variable has a different name. These variable names are based on some naming conventions. Unlike other programming languages, there is no need to declare a variable in Ruby. A prefix is needed to indicate it.
There are four types of variables in Ruby:
   Local variables: name start with a lowercase letter or underscore. it is only accessible or have its scope within the block of its initialization.
   Class variables: name starts with @@ sign. they need to be initialized before use. it belongs to the whole class and can be accessible from anywhere inside the class.
   Instance variables: name starts with @ sign. it belongs to one instance of a class and can be accessed from any instance of the class within a method.
   Global variables: name starts with $ sign. its scope is globally. it can be accessed from any where in a program
Data types: string, number, Boolean, Nill, Arrays, Hashes, Symbol.
interpolation: using variables with the strings(#(variable)).
casting: data type conversion
  to_i--- to_integer
  to_s--- to_String
  to_f-- to_Float
  to_a-- to_array
  to_r-- to_Rational
  to_c-- to_Complex
some methods in strings
  upcase: upper case
  downcase: lowercase
  reverse
  length
multi-line to print:
  1. using `"Hello
              world"`
  2. using %/hello/
  3. using <<Sting 
              hello
              world
              String
Bang(!) operator mainly used in ruby: it will modify the original object.
include: returns if the string is present in the object
global substitute(gsub): it will find the characters which are in one letter and replace it with other(gsub('a', 'u').
substitute(sub): same as global but difference is only it replaces the first letter which is given('a','u')
abs(): absolute value. it should be positive
round(): round off value(no decimal values)
floor(): round down(576.2=576) 
ceil(): round up(576.2=577)
gets: takes the input and goes to next line.
gets.chomp: takes input only
we can create arrays in 2 ways
      1. via class=> array.new
      2. literal array=>[10,9,8,7]
dimensional array: g=[ [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [4,5,6] ]
                         0 1 2   0 1 2    0 1 2
                           0        1       2
Methods in array: 
         push: which inserts the contents
         pop: which returns and deletes the last element
         reverse: which reverse the array
         sort: which will sort the array
         include: check whether the item is in array or not
size(): which gives the size of the array
length(): which gives the length of the array 
range:
         array[1,2]: [start_index, no.of elements]
         array[1..3]: [start_index, end index]include end index value
         array[1...3]: [start_index, end_index]exclude last index value
Conditions
  if condition
      statement
  end


 if condition
     statement
 elsif
      statement
 else
      statement
 end


unless: opposite to if condition
example      
      city="New Delhi"
      unless city="New Delhi" #if the statement is false
         puts "not the capital of india" #this will work
       else
          puts "Capital of india"
       end

condition ? if true run this : if false run this (tenary operator)
example
      puts(5 == 6) ? "5 equals 6" : "5 not equals 6"
      output: 5 not equals 6 
Ruby modifiers:
    eg: age = 15
        puts "you are young" if age<=18 # you are young
        age = 20
        puts "you are young" if age<=18 # Program did not output anything!
       age = 15 
       puts "you are old" unless age<=18 # Program did not output anything!
       age = 25
       puts "you are old again" unless age<=18# you are old again
      name= nil
      name ||= "cat's cradle"
      puts name # it checks whether the name store any item, if name not having any item then the cat's cradle will assign to the anme
switch case
age = 30 #output Job
case age
  when 0..18
    puts "Study"
  when 18..60
    puts "Job"
  when 60..100
    puts "retry"
  else
   puts "Dead"
end


puts "Hello there!" 
g=gets.chomp
case g
  when "English" then puts "Hello!"
  when "French" then puts "Bonjour!"
  when "German" then puts "Guten Tag!"
  when "finnish" then puts "Hallo!"
  else puts "I don't know that language!"
end
